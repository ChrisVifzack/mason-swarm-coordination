### Multi-agent coordination combining flocking heuristics with centroid estimation and tracking

Recently, self-organized distributed computing has developed great appeal in the field of controlling multi-agent systems. Simple interaction rules lead to the emergence of collective behavior and give access to a huge spectrum of tasks such a swarm can perform. This work presents a new approach to decentralized multi-agent coordination by using Reynold's focking heuristics and enhancing them with a velocity-based guidance rule derived from centroid tracking. The proposed algorithm was implemented and simulated with the MASON framework (https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/).
